## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This repository contains our implementation for the *Distributed Systems* course project (Spring 2025). We've developed a **Federated Learning Model** that allows distributed training across multiple client nodes while preserving data privacy.


Hereâ€™s a refined version for your `.md` file:  

---  

## `src` Directory  

The `src` directory contains the base code for a **server-client file transfer system** with **dynamic server discovery** using `Consul`.  

### Current Implementation  
- Both the **client** and **server** are **menu-based**, requiring manual startup for each client.  
- Clients assume that each file sent has a **unique filename** (i.e., it does not already exist on the server).  
- To ensure uniqueness, clients append `_client_<client_id>` to the filename before sending.  

### Required Enhancements  
- Implement an **automatic mode** for testing with multiple clients to streamline the process.
